# Arcade Game Project:  please enjoy game here https://nbrandolini.github.io/arcade-game/

This project involved using Object Oriented Javascript and HTML5 canvas to create a simple frogger game (not so simple for me). The game engine and all artwork were provided by Udacity, and app.js contains the code I wrote after many, many sleepless  hours :dizzy_face:.



###	Object
The goal of this game is to move the player safely across the land to reach the water. The enemy bugs are out to get you and they will spawn at random speeds and locations each time. The winner must reach the water safely.

### Instructions
To start the game, simply load the index.html file.

###	Controls
The controls for the game are simple: just use your up, down, left, and right arrow keys to navigate your player around the map.
